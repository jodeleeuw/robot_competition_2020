# Remote Robot Competition, Spring 2020 

We had to transition the annual robotics competition at Vassar (COGS220) to an online course due to COVID-19 :disappointed:. Thankfully, we were able to continue hands-on by sending students a kit to use at home.

This repository contains my own efforts to solve a series of tasks towards a maze-solving robot.

**Tasks:**

1. Get the robot to move forward for 4ft. :heavy_check_mark: [Solution](https://github.com/jodeleeuw/robot_competition_2020/tree/master/Milestone%201)
2. Follow a line for 4ft.
3. Follow a 2x2 square for at least a full lap.
4. Follow a maze-like pattern with no intersections.
5. Solve a maze with intersections.
6. Solve a maze with intersections and then repeat the maze following a memorized path.
7. Get a final run in the practice maze of under XX seconds.
8. Solve a maze with loops.
